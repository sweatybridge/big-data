                                    <p>The evolution of technology has led to an exponential increase in the amount of information produced per year. Virtually every activity we are involved in translates to some form of big data generated nowadays. 5 exabytes of data is produced everyday and this data ranges from queryable info like credit card transactions, to non queryable ones like videos from surgeries and so on.</p>

                                    <p>Data can be collected from offline sources such as credit card transactions or from the internet by web crawlers such as those used by Google. In a study by Krux in 2012, it was observed that there was a 400% increase in data collection events per page in comparison to 2011, indicating an increase in interest in this data by many companies.</p>
                                    <p>Some of these companies include the aforementioned Google, Social media sites like Facebook and Twitter, which make use of the personal data of useres to explore trends. Other companies (via third party applications) can also make use of this abundance of data for various purposes eg. QuizUp which connects to facebook and has an extensive database of players and favourite topics.</p>
                                    <p>These companies return this data to their local data warehouses for specific analysis, as big data analysis has been shown to be greatly beneficial to business growth and expansion, irrespective of the business size. Take google ad services for instance, which has analysed user search patterns to return personalised adverts.</p>

                        <h3>Some examples of the way Big Data is stored.</h3>

                        <h4 style="color:#C94A00">Object-Based Storage</h4>
                        <p>Object based storage works with a flat architecture where data is stored in buckets. The objects are not organised in a hierarchy like files. They exist at the same level in a flat address space called a storage pool and have their own identifiers. This makes it faster and easier to retrieve data rather than having to delve into deep files structures. Object based storage makes use of metadata.</p>
                        <img src="images/Object1.png" height="350px" weight="350px" style="float:right;"></img>
                        <p>Metadata is a basic piece of information about data that make it easy to find and work with particular attributes of data. Object based storage helps to connect the dots and show relationships between metadata rather than the contents itself. For example it's not as important to know which people visited a particular website as the number of people who came there after a certain article was posted.</p>

                        <h4 style="color:#C94A00">Scale-out NAS</h4>
                        <p>The main reason companies with huge data use Scale-out NAS is because of their potentially limitless expansion while still being managed as a single storage. It is a dedicated hard disk storage device and provides a file based storage system. It is a system that can run simultaneously with different NAS nodes. It makes a copy of the data as backup in the background and has fault tolerance. This means that if one or more nodes fail to work, it will not affect the system without any data loss. Advantages of scale out NAS - cost containment.</p>

                    <h4 style="color:#2E8B57">Map Reduce</h4>
                    <p>MapReduce is a programming model and an associated implementation for processing and generating large data sets. Users specify a map function that processes a key/value pair to generate a set of intermediate key/value pairs, and a reduce function that merges all intermediaste values associated with the same intermediate key. Many real world tasks are expressible in this model.</p>
                    <p>Programs written in this functional style are automatically parallelized and executed on a large cluster of commodity machines. The run-time system takes care of the details of partitioning the input data. This allows programmers without any experience with parallel and distributed systems to easily utilize the resources of a large distributed system.</p>
                     <img src="images/keep-calm-and-map-reduce-9.png" height="300px" width="300px" style="float: right;"></img>
                    <p>"Map" step: The master node takes the input, divides it into smaller sub-problems, and distributes them to worker nodes. A worker node may do this again in turn, leading to a multi-level tree structure. The worker node processes the smaller problem, and passes the answer back to its master node.</p>
                    <p>"Reduce" step: The master node then collects the answers to all the sub-problems and combines them in some way to form the output – the answer to the problem it was originally trying to solve.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h4 style="color:#2E8B57">Uses</h4>
                    <p>MapReduce is useful in a wide range of applications. For example, at Google, MapReduce was used to completely regenerate Google's index of the World Wide Web. It replaced the old ad hoc programs that updated the index and ran the various analyses.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h4 style="color:#2E8B57">Criticism</h4>
                    <p>MapReduce tasks must be written as acyclic dataflow programs, i.e. a stateless mapper followed by a stateless reducer, that are executed by a batch job scheduler. </p>
                    <br>
                    <h4 style="color:#6A5ACD"> About Pig and PigLatin </h4>
                    <p>Pig was initially developed at Yahoo! to allow people using Hadoop® to focus more on analyzing large data sets and spend less time having to write mapper and reducer programs. Like actual pigs, who eat almost anything, the Pig programming language is designed to handle any kind of data—hence the name!</p>
                    <p>Pig is made up of two components: the first is the language itself, which is called PigLatin and the second is a runtime environment where PigLatin programs are executed, like Eclipse and a Java application. Here, we’ll just refer to the whole entity as Pig.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h4 style="color:#6A5ACD">The Programming Language</h4>
                    <p>Let’s first look at the programming language itself so that you can see how it’s significantly easier than having to write mapper and reducer programs.</p>
                    <p>The first step in a Pig program is to LOAD the data you want to manipulate from HDFS(Hadoop Distributed File System).</p>
                    <p>Then you run the data through a set of transformations (which, under the covers, are translated into a set of mapper and reducer tasks)</p>
                    <p>Finally, you DUMP the data to the screen or you STORE the results in a file somewhere.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h4 style="color:#6A5ACD">Pig vs SQL</h4>
                    <p>uses lazy evaluation,</p>
                    <p>declares execution plans,</p>

                        <h4 style="color:#C94A00">Volume</h4>
                        <p>Due to the sheer volume of Big Data, it is sometimes impossible or too computationally expensive to visualise every single piece of information stored. Data scientists have hence developed visual query languages that make use of datastore statistics to limit the search space to only those areas that potentially contain interesting data.</p>
                        <br>
                        <img src="images/segal1.jpg" width="500px" height="375px" style="float: right;"></img>
                        <h4 style="color:#C94A00">Velocity</h4>
                        <p>As information is generated at an increasing rate, it becomes increasingly important for data scientists to capture and analyse data in real time so that they will be able to identify and react immediately to rising trends. However, much of the generated data is noise which forms a huge bottleneck that chokes the effectiveness of existing visualisation techniques. A different approach is hence required to efficiently filter and discard tonnes of meaningless information so that the more interesting bits could be added to the visualisation as they arrive.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h4 style="color:#C94A00">Variety</h4>
                        <p>Unlike relational databases that only store data that can be easily turned into tabular form, Big Data comes in a wide variety of format. Videos, sounds, and images are all examples of non-tabular that have to be analysed in the Big Data world. The ability to extract interesting patterns and features from these new sources of information forms the core of Big Data Visualisation.</p>
