        ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install)"

2. install [nodejs](http://nodejs.org)

        brew install node

3. install [yeoman](http://yeoman.io/)

        npm install -g yo

4. clone this repo

        git clone https://gitlab.doc.ic.ac.uk/lab1314_spring/topics_13.git

        grunt serve

Deployment
===
1. Compile the website source code

        grunt
        
2. Upload the entire `dist` folder to our `project directory`

Project Directory
===
Your entire group project directory is accessible via the web as the URL:

        http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/project/2013/163/g13163xx/

Note: we usually recommend that you put web pages in a subdirectory
of your project directory, for example

/vol/project/2013/163/g13163xx/web/

in which case the above URL would become:

        http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/project/2013/163/g12163xx/web/

You may also want to add a very restrictive .htaccess file to the top
level directory to disallow web browsing of your entire group project
directory.
